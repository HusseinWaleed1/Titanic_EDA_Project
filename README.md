## 🎯 Goal  
Explore the tragic sinking of the Titanic through data! This project analyzes passenger demographics, class, and other factors to uncover **what truly influenced survival rates**.  

## 🔍 Key Insights (Spoilers!)  
- **"Women and Children First?"** ✅  
  - Survival rate for **females: ~74%** vs. **males: ~19%**.  
  - Children under 10 had a **>60% survival rate** (vs. ~38% overall).  
- **Class Matters!** 💎  
  - **1st class passengers**: ~63% survived.  
  - **3rd class passengers**: Only ~24% survived.  
- **Family Size Impact**: Passengers with 1-2 siblings/spouses had higher survival rates.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Python Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` for data wrangling.  
  - `seaborn` & `matplotlib` for stunning visualizations.  
- **Google Colab** for cloud-based analysis.
